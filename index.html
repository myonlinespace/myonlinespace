        How do people across the world spend their time? How do daily activities differ across countries, and how do these differences matter for people’s lives?<br>
        In this article we will explore data and do research on time use.

        Time is the ultimate limited resource. Every one of us has the same “time budget” — 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, giving a total of 8,760 hours — each year of our lives.<br><br>
        How do we spend our time? There are many commonalities across the world: we all sleep, work, eat, and enjoy leisure time. But there are also important differences in the freedom people have to spend time on the things they value most.<br><br>
        Studying how people across the world spend their time provides an important perspective for understanding living conditions, economic opportunities, and general well-being.<br><br>
        Here we present the data on time use. We explore how it differs across countries and over time and how these differences matter for people’s lives.

        Time use from the perspective of an average day

    <div class="section-content">
        Sleep, work, eat, leisure — at a high level most of us spend time on similar activities. But just how similar are the daily activities of people across the world?<br><br>
        This is something worth considering, not just to serve our curiosity but because differences in the way we spend time give us meaningful perspectives on living conditions, economic opportunities, and general well-being.<br><br>
        We explore some of the key patterns that emerge from cross-country time use surveys, and then dig deeper to understand how these differences matter for people’s well-being.<br><br>
        Daily activities: similarities and differences across countries<br><br>
        The data comes from the OECD and brings together estimates from time diaries where respondents are asked to record the sequence of what they did over a specific day, as well as from general questionnaires where respondents are asked to recall the amount of time spent on different activities on a specific day in the previous week.
